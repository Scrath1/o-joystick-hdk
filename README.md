# What is this?
This repository is a fork from olukelo's gimbal repository in which I uploaded his gimbal design converted to the .step format.
Furthermore this repository will hold my personal modifications on his gimbal as well as a modified version of [JFlyer81](https://www.thingiverse.com/jflyer81/designs) F-16 Grip and Hatswitches.
I have also uploaded some arduino code that I will use for my personal build of this combination. Schematics and a parts list may or may not follow.
