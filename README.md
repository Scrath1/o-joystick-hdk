# What is this?
This repository is a fork from olukelo's gimbal repository in which I uploaded his gimbal design converted to the .step format.
Furthermore this repository will hold my personal modifications on his gimbal as well as a modified version of [JFlyer81](https://www.thingiverse.com/jflyer81/designs) F-16 Grip and Hatswitches.
I have also uploaded some arduino code that I will use for my personal build of this combination. Schematics and a parts list may or may not follow.

# Partslist for modified version of gimbal:
- 4x 5x10mm magnets
- 2x SS495A Hall effect sensors (similar sensors should probably be fine too. Just make sure you pick a linear analog sensor and not a digital one)
- 4x M5x35, 2x M5x30 and 2 M5x25 Bolts (The M5x25 need to be countersunk). You will need another 4 M5 Bolts (At least M5x25) for mounting the gimbal to the housing
- M5 Nuts. As many as there are screws.
- 2x springs. I used springs with a length of 9mm and a filament diameter of 0.5mm. ()
- Bearings: 8x MF 105 ZZ, 4x 6802 and 4x 685 ZZ


# Parts to print
